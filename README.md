# Lambda_Api_GW_Handson
Lambda as FAAS &amp; API Gateway &amp; S3 Bucket Combined mechanism

The topics for this hands-on session will be AWS Lambda, function as a service (FaaS). During this Playground we will create two AWS S3 Buckets and using AWS Lambda to synchronize them. In addition, We will show the association between Lambda and API Gateway.

At the end of the this hands-on training, at the end of this hands on you will be creating;
- Create a S3 bucket.
- Create Lambda Function
- Trigger the Lambda Function  with S3 Bucket
- Create a lambda function, that generates a random value and trigger it with API Gateway.
